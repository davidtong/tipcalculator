TipCalculator
=============
#Description
This is a very simple tip calculator developed during an iOS/ Objective-C course sponsored by Box. It is my first mobile app ever, and first time using Objective-C. It is a bit more challenging that I expected, but I am very excited about the opportunity to embrace new things!
